<p>I was long curious about how does Î» calculus become the foundation of formalizaing programming languages. Itâ€™s strange that I havenâ€™t look up the answer until today: Itâ€™s invented so early by Alonzo Church (whom I will write another post for) as an alternative mathematic foundation in 1930s and its relation with programming language was re-discoverred in 1960s.</p>

<p>From the â€œLambda calculus and programming languagesâ€ section of wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As pointed out by Peter Landinâ€™s 1965 paper â€œA Correspondence between ALGOL 60 and Churchâ€™s Lambda-notationâ€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this name quite familiar since I read his paper â€œThe mechanical evaluation of expressionsâ€ before, in which he introduced the first abstract machine for functional programming language, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SECD_machine">SECD machine</a>. This paper also define the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">Closure</a> which becomes a prevalent notion in computer programming nowadays.</p>

<p>Besides of that, his contributions also include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>on ALGO definition</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISWIM">ISWIM</a> programming language</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule">off-side rule</a>, known as â€œindentation-basedâ€ syntax nowadays, popularized by Miranda, Haskell, Python, etc.</li>
  <li>coin the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar">syntactic sugar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>He was much influenced by a study of McCarthyâ€™s LISP and taught <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony Hoare</a> ALGO with Peter Naur and Edsger W. Dijkstra. (Oh yes, definitely 4 more people to write).</p>

<p>I have just download his old, influential paper â€œThe next 700 programming languagesâ€. 
I am sure it will be an enjoyable read.</p>
